### About:

I sincerely love using modern banking, deliveries, marketplaces and other services. Moreover, I am inspired by how much all these services change a person's life - who would have thought 10 years ago that it would be possible to buy shares on the stock exchange from an application on the phone? Or on the Internet to order clothes that will be brought, try them on, and then return them if they donâ€™t fit?

That is why 5 months ago I decided to study web development, because it is the most direct and reliable way to influence what our future will look like right now. I am sure that it is in development that I will be able to get satisfaction from creating services that will be commonplace in the future.

Solution to popular Buzz Fizz test

  for (let n = startNumber; n <= endNumber; n++) {
    let output = ''
    if (n % 3 === 0) {
      output = 'Fizz'
    };
    if (n % 5 === 0) {
      output = 'Buzz'
    };
    if (n % 3 === 0 && n % 5 === 0) {
      output = 'FizzBuzz'
    };
    console.log(output || n)
  }
